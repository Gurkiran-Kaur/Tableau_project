# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The aim is to learn how to convert data into easily consumable visual insights using Tableau

Creating dashboards that help stakeholders make decisions based on a business questions

Communicating insights with the correct visualizations



## Process
Chose the dataset FAA Wildlife Strikes, 2015
 
This is a cleaned table of wildlife strikes from 2000-2015 in the United States. 

Data was connected and different data types were probed in the data

Different visualizations were built to understand more about the dataset

The main categorical features in the table are Effect, when and wildlife

Categorical features were analysed  using appropriate numerical features 

Tried identifying different trends, patterns and key insights in this dataset



## Results
Geospatial occurrences of the strikes were visualized and state of California was found to have highest number of strikes followed by Texas and Florida.
If we compare to rest of the states, this number is too high. Reasons for this can be explored further so that appropriate actions can be taken

Majority of strikes acroos the states was caused during the day probably because of more active wildlife. Also, from the seasonal analysis it was found that during summers, the number of strikes goes up and this has been the trend across all years.

If we try to find which type of species group causes more strikes, then bird group is responsbile for most of them. Specfifically, Gulls, turns, citywakes group causes way more strikes than other birds.

Number of strikes has been consistently increasing and forecasted to be at 4004 at 2017. Variables contributing to this can be explored and can help in tackling this problem and keep numbers down

Tried identifying pattern in cost by origin state and explore further. The interesting point is though number of strikes is more in California, the cost is higher for New York. Need to explore further what variables are contributing to it e.g damage caused and check for outliers, missing values


## Challenges 
Data inconsistency

Inconsistent formats for location lead to mapping errors

Complex data

There were diverse features related to aircraft type, phase of flight  and damage effect which made task of clustering complex

Outlier detection

Ensuring that numerical data such as cost related variables are interpreted correctly

Time was biggest challenge 

## Future Goals
Explore in detail and practice Tableau 

Implement clustering algorithms to identify strike clusters based on aircraft type, phase of flight and damage effect

Probe dataset further and answer more questions related to cost analysis, relation between effect of damage and phase of flight etc

Create a more comprehensive and interactive Dashboard
