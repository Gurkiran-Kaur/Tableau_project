# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The aim is to learn how to convert data into easily consumable visual insights using Tableau

Creating dashboards that help stakeholders make decisions based on a business questions

Communicating insights with the correct visualizations



## Process
Chose the dataset FAA Wildlife Strikes, 2015
 
This is a cleaned table of wildlife strikes from 2000-2015 in the United States. 

Data was connected and different data types were probed in the data

Different visualizations were built to understand more about the dataset

The main categorical features in the table are Effect, when and wildlife

Categorical features were analysed  using appropriate numerical features 

Tried identifying different trends, patterns and key insights in this dataset



## Results


## Challenges 
Data inconsistency

Inconsistent formats for location lead to mapping errors

Complex data

There were diverse features related to aircraft type, phase of flight  and damage effect which made task of clustering complex

Outlier detection

Ensuring that numerical data such as cost related variables are interpreted correctly

Time was biggest challenge 

## Future Goals
Explore in detail and practice Tableau 

Implement clustering algorithms to identify strike clusters based on aircraft type, phase of flight and damage effect

Probe dataset further and answer more questions related to cost analysis, relation between effect of damage and phase of flight etc

Create a more comprehensive and interactive Dashboard
